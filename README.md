Simpel Chessgame Bot for discord, without using Nitro!
------------------------------------------
Replit is a simple option for hosting bots, and you can easily host and edit your bot's code from their web interface.

Go to Replit and create an account.
Create a new Replit project.
Choose "Python" as the language.
Paste your bot's code into the editor.
Set your token as a secret:
In the left sidebar, go to Secrets.
Add a new secret called DISCORD_TOKEN and paste your bot token.
Run your bot by pressing the "Run" button.
Replit will keep your bot online as long as you keep the tab open or use their paid "Always On" feature.

Step-by-Step Guide to Get Your Bot Token:
Go to the Discord Developer Portal:

Visit the Discord Developer Portal.
Log in:

If you're not already logged in, use your Discord credentials to sign in.
Create a New Application:

On the portal homepage, click on "New Application" in the top-right corner.
Give your application (bot) a name (e.g., "Chess Bot") and click "Create".
Navigate to the Bot Section:

On the left sidebar, click "Bot".
Here, you’ll see an option to "Add Bot". Click it, then confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!".
Reveal and Copy Your Token:

Under the "Bot" section, you will see your bot’s username and profile.
Find the section labeled "Token" and click on "Click to Reveal Token".
Copy the token that appears—this is the token you’ll use in your bot's code.
⚠️ Important: Treat this token like a password. Never share it publicly or push it to public repositories. If the token is exposed, anyone can control your bot.

Invite the Bot to Your Server:

In the same "Bot" section, scroll down to find the OAuth2 settings on the left sidebar.
Click on OAuth2, then URL Generator.
Under "Scopes", check "bot".
Under "Bot Permissions", select the necessary permissions (e.g., "Send Messages", "Read Message History", "Add Reactions").
Copy the generated URL, paste it into your browser, and follow the steps to invite your bot to your server.

Select your bot, go to the Bot tab, and ensure that you have Message Content Intent and Server Members Intent enabled.

Enjoy!
